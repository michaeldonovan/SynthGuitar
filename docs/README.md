# A Jekyll Image Gallery

This website illustrates how to integrate a lightGallery/Isotope photo gallery into a Jekyll website. Two example galleries are included. This solution is GitHub Pages friendly and does not require a custom plugin.

## Installing

1. Clone the git repo: `git clone https://github.com/opieters/jekyll-image-gallery-example.git`
2. Change folder: `cd jekyll-image-gallery-example`
3. Install Jekyll: `gem install jekyll`

## Run the Website and Make It Your Own

Run the website with `jekyll s`. Or just view the [GitHub Pages version](https://opieters.github.io/jekyll-image-gallery-example/). To [view the gallery](https://opieters.github.io/jekyll-image-gallery-example/photography/) click on the photography menu item.

[This blogpost](http://www.olivierpieters.be/blog/2016/02/26/creating-a-jekyll-image-gallery.html) explains different parts of the gallery and design choices. Use this guide and the files in this repo to make your own photo gallery.
